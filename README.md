DirectX Samples for Lazarus/FPC

Here I post some samples from DirectX Books and Pages which I translated to Lazarus/FPC.
See how much fun is to code DirectX in pascal :)

Available:
Frank Luna - Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12
  Good book for learning DirectX, only one disadvantage - the samples are writen in C++ ;)
  Chapter 1: XMVector Sample
